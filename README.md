# Lottery-Smart-Contract

This project involves the development of a decentralized lottery system using a smart contract written in Solidity. The smart contract allows players to participate by paying 1 ether and selects a random winner when there are at least 3 players. The entire process is managed by the contract creator, designated as the manager.
